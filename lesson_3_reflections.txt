1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Ans: When multiple people work on the same repository and there is a need to share our work with others.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Ans: In cases where many people contribute to a same remote repository, there may be situations when I wanna update my local repository only after completing the 
work I'm doing. If pulling changes happens automatically, it would mess up a lot of things.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Ans: Branches: Made inside a repository to divert the development path and maintain versions of it.
	 Clones: Used to clone a repositories within local device or between local device and github.
	 Forks: Also used to clone repositories but within github.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Ans: By having such a copy it is easier for us to run git diff and git status commands to find the changes we made locally since we last updated remote repository.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Ans: By sending suggetions through e-mail or other options.It would be hard to maintain all versions and compare them.
